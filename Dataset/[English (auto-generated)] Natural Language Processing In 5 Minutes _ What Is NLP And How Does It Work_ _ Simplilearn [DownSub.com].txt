star wars fans would be familiar with

the golden life-sized hospitality robot

c-3po while star wars might be set in a

galaxy far far away

the reality of having machines talk and

respond to us in a human-like manner

is already a reality which keeps getting

more and more realistic with every

passing day

the people you ask for queries on

websites your smart assistants

even calls made over the internet all of

them have one thing in common

none of them are actually human now you

must be thinking

if they are not human how do they manage

to sound and seem so human-like

how do they respond to me so

intelligently and how are they so

articulate

this my friends is the magic of natural

language processing

what is nlp natural language processing

or nlp

refers to the branch of artificial

intelligence that gives the machines the

ability to read

understand and derive meaning from human

languages

nlp combines the field of linguistics

and computer science to decipher

language structure and guidelines

and to make models which can comprehend

break down and separate significant

details from text and speech

every day humans interact with each

other through public social media

transferring vast quantities of freely

available data to each other

this data is extremely useful in

understanding human behavior and

customer habits

data analysts and machine learning

experts utilize this data to give

machines the ability

to mimic human linguistic behavior this

helps save

millions in terms of manpower and time

as you don't need to always have a

person present

at the other end of a phone nlp is also

a lot more widespread than you may

realize

you use it every day in seemingly normal

and insignificant situations

don't know how to correctly spell a word

autocorrect has you covered

need to see if your article or thesis

will get flagged for copyright

violations

that's okay a plagiarism checker will

search through the web and find

any cases of published documents which

may match your work

line by line while nlp seems really cool

yet a cutting edge and complicated

technology concept

it is actually pretty easy to learn you

start off with a document or an article

to make your algorithm understand what

is going on in it

you need to process it into a form which

is easily comprehensible by the machine

this is no different than making a child

learn to read for the first time

you start off by performing segmentation

which is to break the entire document

down into its constituent sentences

you can do this by segmenting the

article along its punctuations like full

stops and commas

for the algorithm to understand these

sentences we get the words in a sentence

and to explain them individually to our

algorithm

so we break down our sentence into its

constituent words and store them

this is called tokenizing where each

word is called a token

we can make the learning process faster

by getting rid of non-essential words

which do not add much meaning to our

statement

and are just there to make our statement

sound more cohesive

these words such as are and the are

called

stop words now that we have the basic

form of our document

we need to explain it to our machine we

first start off by explaining that some

words like skipping

skips skipped are the same word with

added prefixes and suffixes

this is called stemming we also identify

the base words for different word tense

mood gender etc this is called

limitization

stemming from the base word lemma now we

explain the concept of nouns

verbs articles and other parts of speech

to the machine

by adding these tags to our words this

is called part of speech tagging

next we introduce our machine to pop

culture references and everyday names by

flagging names of movies

important personalities or locations etc

that may occur in the document this is

called named entity tagging

once we have our base words and tags we

use a machine learning algorithm like

naive bayes

to teach our model humans sentiment and

speech at the end of the day

most of the techniques used in nlp are

simple grammar techniques that we have

been taught in school

here is a question for you which of

these nlp techniques

is used to obtain words from sentences a

stemming

b tokenization c limitization

d segmentation give it a thought and
