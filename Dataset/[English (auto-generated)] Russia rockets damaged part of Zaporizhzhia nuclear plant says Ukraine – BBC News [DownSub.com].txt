next ukraine and russia have blamed each

other for the shelling of the russian

occupied zaparisha nuclear power plant

the attacks are said to have also hit

nearby high voltage power lines

ukrainian and western officials have

accused russian forces of using the

complex to launch attacks leaving the

ukrainians unable to respond for fear of

causing a disaster ukraine's president

zelenski said the kremlin must take

responsibility for what he called a

terror attack

today the occupiers created another very

dangerous situation for all of europe

the sheldon nuclear power plant and have

done it twice in a day this is the

largest nuclear station on our continent

and any shelling is an overt blatant

crime a terrorist act

let's get the latest now our

correspondent hugo pacheco is uh live

for us in kiev hi there hugo so stakes

particularly high when well the largest

nuclear power plant in europe is at the

center of potential uh hostilities

yeah we've heard that from president

zielinski saying that russia again was

creating another uh extremely risky

situation at the zappos

nuclear power plant now this is a

complex that has been on the russian

occupation since the very beginning of

march even though ukrainian technicians

still operating the facility now

yesterday tensions were high with

ukrainian and russian officials trading

accusations the ukrainians uh saying

that russian forces shelled the site

twice in one of those attacks a reactor

had to be disconnected but we haven't

had any kind of reports suggesting that

there was any kind of radioactive leak

but the russians are saying that well

the ukrainians were the ones behind

these attacks and they've described it

as a criminal act the reality is that

for days we've been hearing from

ukrainian officials also us officials

saying that the russians have

essentially turned this nuclear site

into a military base and in fact

yesterday i spoke with the mayor of the

city of nicopo

which is located near this uh nuclear

plant and he said that his city has been

under constant shelling by russian

forces positioned

at the zappoligia nuclear power plant

and he said that these forces are using

this site as a nuclear shield

and hugo just away from that new the

incidents they're deeply troubling of

course at the nuclear power plant i want

to just talk about grain because we've

been following it so closely the

resumption of those shipments

where are we now is there expectation

that the number of ships needed to try

and get operations back up and running

properly could start moving

yeah it seems so far so good for this

deal three more ships left ukraine

yesterday carrying uh almost 60 000 tons

of corn one of those ships is going to

the uk and the first ship uh to be

loaded is expected to arrive uh in the

next few days so all of this obviously

is happening under that landmark deal

that was signed uh by russia ukraine the

united nations turkey to allow ukraine

to resume uh its grain exports ukraine

is one of the largest exporters of grain

in the world and the hope is that this

deal will ease a global food crisis so

that's why everybody's paying attention

to what's happening with these ships

okay hugo thanks very much that update

for us live there in cube thank you
