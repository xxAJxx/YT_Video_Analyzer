space

the filthy frontier

humans successfully put their first

object into space in 1957 the sputnik

satellite

and after 75 years of spacecraft being

sent into orbit it's a lot easier to go

for launch but a lot messier once you're

up there

governments now have to share space with

private companies and without much in

the way of regulation it's starting to

get so congested we don't know exactly

what's up there anymore

some estimates say around 5000

satellites in orbit with fewer than half

actually working

and when a satellite stops functioning

it still keeps orbiting which is a

problem for the useful ones

satellites when they die on these

orbital highways they just keep on going

at these very fast speeds some of the

relative speeds between satellites that

are crisscrossing each other it's like

15 times the speed of a bullet so that's

uh

that's pretty gnarly to think about and

um yeah every once in a while two of

these things

find each other in space at these very

high speeds collide and break up into

very smaller pieces and that sort of

stuff and most of the things that could

damage a satellite that's providing a

service or a capability that we care

about most of those things are not

trackable because they're too small

moribus co-founder of privateer which

tracks space debris it aims to collect

information from many different origins

like telescopes and radars physical

sensors even news articles and turn it

into usable data for developers

imagine a massive machine readable

spreadsheet

where all the data is lined up so the

column headings make sense

it's one of many companies and space

agencies taking part in the summit for

space sustainability at london's science

museum

these are the people hoping to clean up

up there

and it's harder than you think because

you can't exactly use a vacuum cleaner

in a vacuum

one solution is on orbit servicing

removing old satellites and refueling

others yes a robot mechanic and tow

truck in space

another outfit clear spaces concept

shows four arms to catch and hug a dead

satellite before cruelly pulling it into

the atmosphere to burn it up sounds

complicated well it is rocket science

this is hard technically so going up to

space and removing a satellite with with

uh some some claws robotic arm or some

nets is hard to do right because

operating a robot from hundreds of miles

away is tough to do but it's also tough

uh politically and

economically and with regulations

because there's no real rules that

govern how we work in outer space

like me and the attendees you'll have

worked out why we want to keep things

clean in orbit we use satellites to

check the weather find our way around

even for financial transactions

and a quick look at nasa's interactive

website eyes on the earth shows there's

so much more we can do from space to

help with earthbound challenges like

climate change so what sort of things

can be measured from space that we might

not know about so space data and

measurements give us not just beautiful

pictures of the earth but also

information about weather changes the

climate data population density and

other things that all can be integrated

into the solutions that we really need

and here i'm talking about giving

farmers for example real-time data about

when's the best time to plant their

harvest and when is the best time to

harvest their fields

so we depend on space every day check

and it needs to be tidied up check so

how do we help humans think as one big

tribe i mean we all share this planet

right

it's not going to be any one thing

governments are going to have to have

more regulation companies are going to

have to engage in shared best practices

companies are going to have to exchange

information academia is going to have to

continue to study this and give us the

data so we can make decisions

most interestingly these solutions come

from companies that compete and

cooperate with each other at the same

time

an incredibly effective business model

sharing data and ideas to accelerate

progress for everyone

because speed is of the essence when it

comes to cleaning up after ourselves

then we can keep those orbital highways

open for the next generation and beyond
